Copy and pasted this from the following thread; i'm just putting it here incase the thread disappears for whatever reason. Credit to the user with the mildly offensive username: https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/30/6516193260173485339/
* Please note Ive tweaked this to be linux specific to help Steamdeck/Linux users, the Windows fix can be found on the above steamcommunity link.

1. Open the folder where steam is installed
-On linux this is: /home/.local/share/Steam

2. Open the "logs" folder
-This is hidden by default, press ctrl+h to re-enable or click on the three dots menu and select 'Show Hidden Files'

3. Open the content_log.txt file
-It can be found here: /home/.local/share/Steam/logs

4. Search for "failed". I found a entry that said
-You can ignore these 'failures': [2024-03-06 08:53:59] Validation: 23 chunks failed to read of 23 total in file "data\df59230692f9cd1c.stream" (None)
- What you want is something like this: [2024-03-06 08:23:25] AppID 553850 update canceled : Failed updating depot 553853 while reading chunk "45e46c88f4059f7a586c310af9ba360f231e13b4" (Read Failed) (Corrupt game files) "/home/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Helldivers 2/data/d2711cd33fc143e1.stream"
- The important thing to look for is the specified path: '/home/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Helldivers 2/data/d2711cd33fc143e1.stream'
- Repeat this as necessary to isolate the failed or corrupted files. 
5. Open the file location listed in your failed entry and delete the listed file
- In the above example navigate to '/home/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Helldivers 2/data/d2711cd33fc143e1.stream' and delete the .stream file
6. From here, update the software via steam via the Downloads panel and then wait for the updates to apply, relaunch the software and it will work. 
- Should the software not run at this point please try using a different version of proton such as Experimental or a GE Release.
